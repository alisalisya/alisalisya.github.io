		<p>A day before Christmas holiday, bas company has called me during class and informed that my bus trip on that day was cancelled due to the flood in Kelantan. I was very sad and frustrated since I really wanna go home to heal my homesick. When I went back to my rent house, I cried to my housemate and one of them decided to bring me with her. Guess where was I went? It was Penang! What the most exciting thing is this is my first time in Penang! </p>

		<p>I believe those words saying we live only once in this life so enjoy your everyday like there's no tommorow. This is my first assignment so my groupmate and I need to do site visit at the place we chose which is Seremban, Negeri Sembilan. We went to a 2 days and a night trip there. At the night, we suddenly comes out with last minute idea to go Port Dickson with the reason "healing" lmao. The ride took more than an hour. We talked to each other a lot on that day. Since that, we all are become closer. </p>
